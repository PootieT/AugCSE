# Replace Numerical Values ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This perturbation changes the numerical values appearing in text.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Generated transformations display high similarity to the 
source sentences i.e. the code outputs highly precise generations. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc. 

The accuracy of a RoBERTa model (fine-tuned on IMDB) on a subset of IMDB sentiment dataset = X
The accuracy of the same model on the perturbed set = X

The average bleu score of a distillbert model (fine-tuned on xsum) on a subset of xsum dataset = X
The average bleu score of same model on the pertubed set = X

## Previous Work
1) There has also been some recent work in the contrast sets of the GEM Benchmark (ACL 2021):

  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}
}
```

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation. Unlike a paraphraser, it is not capable of
 generating linguistically diverse text.
